# ghOrgTool

A silly little app to streamline the process of checking a users account for the correct setup and adding if ok.  

It will run the following checks on the user account:
* requires a public email address
* requires 2-FA enabled
* requires Name set on account 

It will use the SSO connection to link a user email to an account, but the user will need to be in the SSO context


## Installation
* Install go
  ```
  brew install go
  ```
* Install the tool
  ```
  go install github.com/glow-example-org/ghOrgTool@latest
  ```
* Add your GOBIN path to your path, by adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`
  ```
  export PATH="~/go/bin:$PATH"
  ```

## Configuration

### Authentication
The app requires a GitHub Token with User and Org permissions. The token is loaded in the following priority order:

1. **Environment Variable**: `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`
2. **Configuration File**: `github_token` field in the config file (see below)
3. **`.netrc` File**: looks for a machine record for `api.github.com` in your [.netrc](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html) file

### User Configuration File
You can customize settings by creating a configuration file. The tool will automatically look for a config file in the following locations based on your operating system:

* **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/ghOrgTool/config.json`
* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\ghOrgTool\config.json`

#### Quick Setup with `--init`

The easiest way to create a configuration file is to use the interactive initialization command:

```bash
ghOrgTool --init
```

This will:
- Prompt you for the organization login
- Prompt you for your default team name
- Optionally prompt for your GitHub personal access token
- Create the config file in the correct location for your OS
- Set appropriate file permissions (Unix/macOS only)

**Example:**
```bash
$ ghOrgTool --init
Configuration Initialization
============================

Enter organization login [example-org]: sandbox-org

Enter default team name [Default Team]: Engineering Team

Enter GitHub personal access token (optional):
  Leave empty to use GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable or .netrc
Token: ghp_abc123xyz456

✓ Configuration saved to: /Users/username/.config/ghOrgTool/config.json
✓ File permissions set to 600 (user read/write only)

Configuration summary:
  Organization Login: sandbox-org
  Default Team: Engineering Team
  GitHub Token: ***configured***
```

#### Rotating/Updating Your GitHub Token

If you need to update or rotate your GitHub token (e.g., for security reasons or token expiration), use the `--rotate-token` command:

```bash
ghOrgTool --rotate-token
```

This will:
- Preserve your existing configuration settings (like default team)
- Prompt you for a new GitHub token
- Update only the token in the configuration file
- Maintain secure file permissions

**Example:**
```bash
$ ghOrgTool --rotate-token
Rotate GitHub Token
===================

Current configuration has a token set.

Enter new GitHub personal access token:
  Leave empty to remove the token from config
New Token: ghp_new_token_xyz789

✓ Token updated in: /Users/username/.config/ghOrgTool/config.json
✓ File permissions verified (600)

✓ GitHub Token: ***configured***
```

**Note:** You can also remove the token from your configuration by leaving the input empty when prompted. This is useful if you want to switch to using an environment variable or .netrc file instead.

#### Manual Configuration

The configuration file should be in JSON format and supports the following options:

```json
{
  "org_login": "your-org-login",
  "default_team": "Your Team Name",
  "github_token": "ghp_your_github_token_here"
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `org_login`: The GitHub organization login used by org-level operations (defaults to "example-org" if not specified)
- `default_team`: The default team name to use when adding users (defaults to "Default Team" if not specified)
- `github_token`: Your GitHub personal access token (optional, only if not using environment variable or .netrc)

**Example Configuration:**
```json
{
  "org_login": "sandbox-org",
  "default_team": "Engineering Team",
  "github_token": "ghp_abc123xyz456"
}
```

**Minimal Configuration (org + team):**
```json
{
  "org_login": "sandbox-org",
  "default_team": "Engineering Team"
}
```

**Security Note:** If you store your GitHub token in the config file, make sure the file has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Manual File Creation

If you prefer to create the configuration file manually instead of using `--init`:

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ghOrgTool
cat > ~/.config/ghOrgTool/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "org_login": "your-org-login",
  "default_team": "Your Team Name",
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/ghOrgTool/config.json
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\ghOrgTool"
Set-Content -Path "$env:APPDATA\ghOrgTool\config.json" -Value @'
{
  "org_login": "your-org-login",
  "default_team": "Your Team Name",
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here"
}
'@
```

### Tools

#### User account check
The tool can take a repository name, a user name or a user email (which can only be looked up via the SSO)

In the case of a User we run some tests:
    ```shell
    $ ghOrgTool someuser
    
    2026/02/02 16:20:21 Using provided login: someuser
    2026/02/02 16:20:21 Processing someuser
    2026/02/02 16:20:21 Validated Pre-requisites for someuser GitHub Email: someuser@email.com
    ```
It will run the following validation checks:
* User has a public email address
* User has a name
* User is a member of the Organisation
* User has 2FA enabled (we don't check for insecure 2fa at the moment)

Once the checks are complete it will list the teams a user has access to
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool someuser
  2022/05/16 11:55:52 Validated Pre-requisites for someuser GitHub Email: someuser@somedomain.com
  2022/05/16 11:55:52 User someuser is a admin of example-org
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 User someuser is a member of the following teams
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 * Team Alpha (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-alpha)
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 * Team Bravo (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-bravo)
  ...
  ```
If the argument is a repository, list the teams that have access to a repository (and what level of access they have)
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool somerepo
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 Repository somerepo has the following teams with access:
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 * Team Alpha (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-alpha) pull
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 * Team Bravo (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-bravo) push
  2022/05/16 11:55:53 * Team Yankee (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-yankee) admin
  ...
  ```

#### User Repository Access Report
Report a user's effective (highest) permission level on a specific repository, broken down by which teams grant that access.

Accepts a username or email address. Use `--repo` to specify the target repository.
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool --user-repo-access --repo somerepo someuser
  Access report: someuser → example-org/somerepo

  Effective permission: write

  Via teams:
    - Team Alpha (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-alpha): read
    - Team Bravo (https://github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/team-bravo): write
  ```

Also works with email:
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool --user-repo-access --repo somerepo someuser@somedomain.com
  ```

#### GitHub Actions Storage Report
List the top 10 repositories in the organization by GitHub Actions cache usage and include org-level billable constrained Actions storage.

```shell
$ ghOrgTool --list-actions-storage
Org Actions shared storage billing summary:
  Billable constrained storage: 42 GB-month
  Estimated total shared storage: 64 GB-month
  Days left in billing cycle: 12

Top 10 repositories by GitHub Actions cache storage in example-org:

 1. example-org/repo-a                               3.00 GiB  4 active caches
 2. example-org/repo-b                             850.0 MiB  2 active caches
 3. example-org/repo-c                              12.0 KiB  1 active caches
```

This report uses the organization-level Actions cache usage endpoint, so the GitHub token must have at least `read:org` scope.

#### Recent Admin Grants
Scan all repositories in the organization for users who were granted direct admin collaborator access in the last 24 hours and who still hold that access. For each match the settings/access URL is printed so you can review or revoke the grant immediately.

```shell
$ ghOrgTool --recent-admin-grants
Users granted admin access in the last 24 hours (still active) in example-org:

1. alice → sample-orchestrator
  Granted by: org-admin
   Granted: 2026-04-15 09:12:00 UTC
   Access settings: https://github.com/example-org/sample-orchestrator/settings/access

2. bob → sample-api
  Granted by: repo-owner
   Granted: 2026-04-15 14:05:00 UTC
   Access settings: https://github.com/example-org/sample-api/settings/access
```

This command queries the organization audit log and validates current permission on matched users/repositories. The GitHub token must have `repo` and `read:org` scopes, and must be able to read org audit logs.

#### Reset Invite 
This is a wrapper for removing the SSO connection for a user (for when SSO doesn't link correctly)

This can be done using username; 
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool --reset someuser 
  2022/05/16 12:02:04 Reset Link: https://github.com/orgs/ORG/people/someuser/sso
  ```
Or, via email
  ```shell
  $ ghOrgTool --reset someuser@somedomain.com 
  2022/05/16 12:02:04 Reset Link: https://github.com/orgs/ORG/people/someuser/sso
  ```
